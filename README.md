# Splash App — Next.js Project

A modern **Next.js** application showcasing best practices in web development, including shared layouts, reusable components, TypeScript interfaces, routing techniques, and responsive UI design. The project provides a solid foundation for building scalable and AI-powered applications with a clean and professional architecture.

---

## Overview

**Splash App** demonstrates how to structure a Next.js project efficiently using the App Router. It integrates Tailwind CSS, Google Fonts, and TypeScript to deliver a seamless developer experience while focusing on maintainability and performance.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Implement shared layout components using the **DRY principle**
- Configure and use **Google Fonts** with Tailwind CSS
- Utilize **imperative routing** with `useRouter`
- Organize code using TypeScript interfaces
- Build reusable and modular React components
- Implement custom **404 error pages**
- Apply responsive design techniques
- Structure a clean and scalable project architecture

---

## Key Concepts

### Layout Components
Reusable **Header**, **Footer**, and **Layout** components to maintain design consistency across pages.

### Component Architecture
UI components are modular and reusable, simplifying maintenance and future extension.

### Routing
Supports:
- Declarative routing using `<Link />`
- Imperative navigation via `router.push()`

### Tailwind Styling
A utility-first workflow for fast and responsive design.

### TypeScript Integration
Interfaces for props and components ensure strong typing and safer code.

### Error Handling
Custom `not-found.tsx` enhances user experience for invalid routes.
